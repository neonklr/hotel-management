# Project Hotel Management

### Setup

You can choose any of the following methods to setup the project.

#### 1. Using poetry

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) using command `pip install poetry`
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies

Optionally, if you are a vscode user, you can add the generated venv path to the environment paths of vscode to ensure auto-activation of the virtual environment.

#### 2. Using pip

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install .` to install the dependencies

PLEASE NOTE : doing this directly in your global environment is not recommended. Use a virtual environment instead. This method is intended for those with alternate methods to generate virtual environments other than poetry.
